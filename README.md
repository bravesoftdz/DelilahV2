## Building from Source

* you'll need fpc at a minimum and I'd recommend using [fpcupdeluxe](https://github.com/LongDirtyAnimAlf/fpcupdeluxe) to install for your platform (lazarus recommended)
* clone this repo with `git clone --recrusive` (will pull appropriate submodules)
* in lazarus you can open the project file for SimpleBot (`ui\SimpleBot.lpi`) and build with `F9`
